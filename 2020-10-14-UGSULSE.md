- I really enjoyed how Dr. Moore (check spell) tied together a lot of pressing issues, and helped clarify how seemingly unrelated and large problems in society today can all kind of be helped together
- I enjoyed how Dr. Moore gave us actionable advice on how to improve our resumes
- I enjoyed how he helped to show us a path forward into the ever changing future of our country





​	I really enjoyed the Undergraduate Lecture Series talk by Dr. Moore, he gave a lot of really good advice that helped give me a sense of direction going forwards. His talk also helped to tie a lot of the issues plaguing America today together, and give me a better understanding of what's going on.

​	Starting with the smallest scope topic Dr. Moore discussed, he gave advice on how to build a good resume going forward into our ever changing world. He talked about how we should be focusing on gaining as much experience as we can before we graduate, because moving forward adaptability will be more important than raw academic credentials. Instead of focusing just on our studies, we should be focusing on the opportunities we see to work in the field we want to go into. I have already sort of been following this advice myself in the past, having interned at an ad agency between sophomore and junior year of high school. I also did as much work in photography and videography as I possibly could, whether as freelance advertising for local businesses or photographing my teacher's adoption. Where Dr. Moore's advice comes in to the picture for me is all of the opportunities at the University of Texas that he highlighted throughout his speech, especially the study abroad programs UT has.
