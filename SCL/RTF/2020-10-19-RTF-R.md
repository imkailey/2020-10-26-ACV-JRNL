### instructions

1. Select a historical magazine from mediahistoryproject.org. Just make sure it is 1) a magazine, not a book and 2) that it was published before 1968. 
2. Read your magazine cover to cover. Digitally flip through all of the pages. Look at both the articles and the advertisements. 
3. Find something you're curious about or never heard of. Then, use Wikipedia. Use Wikipedia to do a little more reading about at least one film, topic, person, product, etc. 
4. Write a 2-3 page reflection essay that answers these three questions: Your magazine is a snapshot of Hollywood's image at a particular point in time. What stories is Hollywood telling about itself in your magazine? What did you follow up on using Wikipedia? What perspective did you get from Wikipedia that you didn't get from the magazine, and vice versa? What's something that you were surprised to learn? 
5.  Submit via canvas your reflection (with a citation and link to your magazine) in a Word document.
