## CH7
### how Octavia Butler turns me on

- OB shows how everyone can love everyone
- society forces us to love and live for white straight men
  - for one person forever
  - constrains us
  - makes us learn to lie in love
  - women aren't allowed love
  - we're taught love is limited in amount
## CH8
### ?
- We need radical honesty
  - allows for two way communication
  - makes our lives align with a sense of belonging
  - eventually helps everyone be better going forward
