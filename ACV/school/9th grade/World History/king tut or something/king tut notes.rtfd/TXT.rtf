He was given one more year to find it, and in November 1922, Carter\'92s team discovered the steps of the tomb, and they led to an ancient sealed door with the name Tutankhamen on it. When Carter and Lord Carnarvon (his sponsor) entered the tomb\'92s inner chamber on November 26, they were surprised to find it almost completely intact, with its treasures untouched after more than 3,000 years.\
